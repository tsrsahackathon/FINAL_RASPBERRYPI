It operates based on fundamental laws that govern the behavior of energy and its conversion from one form to another. It is also instrumental in understanding phase transitions, chemical reactions, and the behavior of materials under different circumstances. By employing the principles of thermodynamics, scientists and engineers can analyze complex systems and predict their behavior, thus enhancing the efficiency of energy conversion processes.
